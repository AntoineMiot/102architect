Epitech project - Module Mathematique

Subject :

You are working on a homeplanning software for an firm of architects. The software should allow a simplifi- cation of the plan drawing process, and integrate various features, such as scale management, changing the point of view, moving doors and windows along walls. . . You are in charge of the part concerning geometric transformations (rotation to change point of view, translation to move an object, scaling to zoom in and out, reflection and any combination of these transformations).


So, the goal of this project is to develop an application to compute points images in the plan after several transformations. To make it nice and clean, you chose to use homogeneous coordinates. How clever of you. O being the origin of both axis, here are the transformations to be implemented:

• Translation,
• Scaling,
• Rotation centered at O,
• Reflection over any axis that passes through O,
• Any combination of the previous transformations.
